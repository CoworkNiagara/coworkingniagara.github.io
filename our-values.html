  <h1><span>Five Values. One Community. </span>What Is a Coworking Community? How Cowork Niagara Does Things</h1>
  <p>We've thought a lot about the kind of community we want to build. We distilled those thoughts into values in the spirit of <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org">The Agile Manifesto</a> and other such documents. </p>
  <p>While there is value in the things on the right, we value those on the left more.</p>
  
  <ul class="values">
    <li>
      <h2>Being done over being perfect</h2>
      <p>Choosing is more important than choosing correctly. So many of the decisions we call 'the right ones' are made best once a project is in motion. We celebrate our successes, large and small. We're constantly learning how we can improve individually and together.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Collaboration over competition</h2>
      <p>Each member brings special talents to the group. We cooperate, not compete, to solve problems and secure new work. We are each students and teachers.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Individual empowerment over hierarchy</h2>
      <p>We continually learn from one another. Everyone's contribution is equally important as we work together to reach our goals. If someone has an idea that will benefit the group, they should feel as if they can just run with it.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Interaction over prospecting</h2>
      <p>We believe that building lasting business relationships, exchanging ideas, and spreading knowledge helps us grow as people and professionals.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h2>Iteration over detailed plans</h2>
      <p>Cowork Niagara started as a grassroots movement that continues to expand. We follow this model as we plan events, activities, and milestones. We prefer small, frequent steps so that we can adjust our course as we learn.</p>
