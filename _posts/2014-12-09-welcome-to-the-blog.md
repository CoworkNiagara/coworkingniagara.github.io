#So this coworking thing is really catching on, eh?
Posted by Trevor Twining on {{ page.date }}

We're gaining a lot of momentum these past few months. Here's some of the highlights.

* We reached the 100th member on our facebook page (congratulations [@jaytennier] (http://twitter.com/#jaytennier)). The great part is we're still growing.
* Our incorporation papers will be filed by the end of the month.
* The lease offer is proceeding well. We think we're past all the major hurdles now.
* Our barnraising gave us a richly detailed set of initial messaging, strategy, and the structual and copy assets to give us a firm foundation moving forward.
* Our average # of weekly participants has gone up 50% this quarter from eight to twelve people.

All of these things are important. They show the growth of the community and the financial fitness to operate a dedicated space. What strikes me as most important of all these things though is how much people are making working together a part of their daily routine, even when they don't have to.

Our type of work can be done anywhere. In fact, sometimes we prefer to work in isolation in order to reach the level of focus we need. Despite the need for occasional focus, many people decide instead to reach out into the broader freelance community and work alongside others. Not because they have to, like an office environment, but because they *choose* to. This is the most important metric we will have in our movement going forward. 

I'm grateful to all of you for helping make these advances. It's your persistent effort -- moving each day towards the destination. This shared effort is what makes our coworking community the greatest and most productive place to work in the Niagara Region. I'm always humbled by all your awesomeness.
