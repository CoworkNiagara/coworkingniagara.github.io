Cowork Niagara is pleased to announce a new partnership with Startup Canada and seven other Ontario coworking spaces that ensures entrepreneurs can access quality workspaces when travelling across the country.

“The partnerships established through the Startup Canada Startup Space Fund will give entrepreneurs living in and travelling to Ontario easy access to innovative places to work,” said Victoria Lennox, CEO of Startup Canada. “It’s another step forward in connecting entrepreneurs to local support and showcasing what the province has to offer.”

“Cowork Niagara members have always been active participants in the Niagara startup ecosystem,” said Trevor Twining, President of Cowork Niagara. “This formal partnership with Startup Canada is a logical extension of that activity and we couldn’t be happier to help Startup Canada build this pan-Canadian support network for entrepreneurial activity.”

Entrepreneurs who come to Niagara will be able to work in Cowork Niagara’s current St. Catharines space at no charge. With the proximity to other local startup community participants like Innovate Niagara and other amenities of a vibrant downtown St. Catharines, the central location is a great fit.

The program will launch in the first quarter of 2016. As of today, though, Cowork Niagara is honouring Startup Canada Passport visits.
