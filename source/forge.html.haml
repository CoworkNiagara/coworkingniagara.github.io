    %p At <a href="http://coworkniagara.com">Cowork Niagara</a>, we’re driven by passion, but we’ve also learned to <strong>execute consistently</strong>. Through experimenting, measuring and iterating, we learn what melds together and what must be discarded to the scrap heap.
    %p We’ve applied this principle to our co-op and it’s worked well. We’ve applied it when teaching sales skills to our members in our Freelancer Lab and it’s successful there, too.
    %p For the past year, we’ve been testing this crucible model with startup co-ops. The results are leading to a new approach to building co-ops that brings together <strong>the best parts of startup culture, independence, bootstrap funding and traditional co-op development</strong>. It is where the pressure of results meets the heat of a new co-op’s passion, shaped and tempered by the force of iterative improvement.
    %p We call this project the <strong>Co-op Forge</strong>. And it’s helping craft <strong>stronger, more resilient businesses</strong>.
