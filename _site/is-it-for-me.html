  <h1>What does a <strong>coworking community</strong> offer me?</h1>
  <p>Cowork Niagara offers independent professionals more than just a shared workspace. When you join our community, youâ€™ll find an environment where you can connect with other entrepreneurs, share your ideas and benefit from the group's collective knowledge.</p> 
  <ul class="testimonials">

      <h3>Allison, writer. Member</h3>
      <p class="quote"> As a new freelancer, the opportunity to connect with other professionals and learn from their experience, as well as contribute to the community by using my skills and talents, has been so rewarding. Our collective intelligence, determination and desire to see one another succeed helps us grow individually and as a group.</p>

      <h3>JF, Search marketing, startup advocate. Member</h3>
      <p class="quote">I'm around other people that know what it's like to work hard to create great results. There's a positive exchange of ideas and emotional understanding that's at the root of any great work place, even though we are all working on separate projects and businesses.</p>
    </li>

      <h3>Laura, grad student, writer. Member</h3>
      <p class="quote">...although we are all working on different projects, it gives some needed structure to my weeks. I set specific goals for what I will accomplish while working alongside others and I feed off of the collective energy.</p>
    </li>

      <h3>Russ, virtual team specialist. Member</h3>
      <p>Coworking Niagara is a good fit for me because I am a partner in a small boutique consultancy specializing in organizational development and change management in business environments which are quickly becoming virtual worlds of work and learning. My experience with the development of virtual communities have led to me to realize the importance of balancing my virtual life with opportunities to build cross disciplinary relationships with other professionals in our local community on a face-to-face basis.  I am convinced that this is critical to personal, professional and community growth. Coworking Niagara is an ideal environment to make this all happen.</p>
    </li>

      <h3>Amy, writer, artisan. Member</h3>
      <p>Coworking is a good fit for me because it gets me out of the house and into a crowd of inspirational people with whom I can work, learn and grow. Coworking is to the freelancer what water is to the thirsty man.</p>
