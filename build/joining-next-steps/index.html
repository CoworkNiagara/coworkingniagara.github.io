    You’ve just joined Cowork Niagara: a community for Niagara’s independent workforce. We’re so happy
    you made that decision! You must be very smart! But you’re probably wondering “what do I do next?"
  </p>

  <p>
    Here's some things you can do to start making the most of your membership.
  </p>

  <h2>Participate in our member-only events</h2>
  <p>
    These events are designed to help improve your personal practice. There’s lots of meetups and
    workshops running to help you sell better, keep your clients happy, and collect those accounts.
    All the things about your practice that you probably don’t like doing because they feel awkward.
    That’s probably the best way we can help.
  </p>

  <h2>Start using the meeting space</h2>
  <p>
    Our meeting space holds up to 30 people, and is ideal for presentations, seminars, board meetings,
    workshops and more. Show your clients how a dynamic, creative environment serves to help you do your
    job better. In the process, you’ll grow your clients’ confidence in your abilities as a professional,
    and have more productive meetings because you don’t have to contend with the noise of a cafe or get
    too personal in your home office.
  </p>

  <h2>Engage your fellow members</h2>
  <p>
    Talk to our members, and see how your respective practices can complement one another. Send out a few
    posts about problems you help solve. Give useful advice up front before people need your services and
    you’ll find that they think of you first when the time comes to contract someone.
  </p>

  <h2>Pick a plan to use the coworking space</h2>
  <p>
    Your membership helps us run all these events and activities. We <em>love</em> that you’re willing to
    do that. But we want to help you, too. We can do that best when you pick one of our usage plans for
    the space. Being here in a regular capacity, learning from other coworkers, growing your practice.
    It’s making that commitment — <strong>to each other</strong >— that will allow your practice to grow
    <em>by up to 30% this year</em>.
  </p>

  <h2>Help us grow</h2>

  <p>
    Do you know other freelancers, solopreneurs or other members independent workforce? Has the transition
    to self-employment been difficult? We can help! Get them in touch with us and help them see that they
    might be working independently, but they’re definitely not alone.
