    Our space has been beautifully renovated and is extremely spacious. The front of the space has
    a large group of windows offering an incredible amount of natural light in during the day, as
    well as an interesting atmosphere during the evening. The main floor is setup with multiple
    workstations that members can choose from. A bar height multi-user workstation is located at the
    front of the building, offering a fantastic view of the bustling of the downtown core. Whiteboards
    allow the visualizing of ideas, and our own Book and Tech Library is a great resource. We have a
    fully-equipped kitchenette for member use, complete with coffee maker, kettle, toaster oven, and
    microwave. The main floor is wheelchair accessible as well as an accessible washroom.

    first serve basis. This space is isolatable from the main space above and has 2 washrooms attached
